# Where does the Game start?

# What did you hope to accomplish?
This project served as a stepping stone towards the horror aspect in Virtual Reality. This whole scene can feel more like a demo since we only had 2 weeks to work on it. Additionally, we could only work on it 2 days a week in the computer lab. The music surrounds the player in an eerie environment which can give the sense of immediately exiting but also simulate the fear of being chased for your life and pulling a clutch as the jerry cans are scattered in various locations. The adrenaline from this can give the player the feeling of relief and accomplishment as they have to strategize to pull off a win.
