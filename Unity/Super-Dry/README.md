## Super-Dry

# Objective of the Game
This was a group project that had the objective of battling a boss after two or three rounds. There was a lot of strategizing as the projectiles drew upon the player's availability of water or staying hydrated. A goal to be accomplished is to defeat the unity-free asset enemies and collect the coins. This would introduce the prospect of trading in which you can trade for items such as a water bottle to prepare for difficult enemies.

# What did you hope to learn?
This was a team-building exercise, in which I needed to cooperate and collaborate with my colleagues in delivering a fully functional demo. I learned that dynamic lightning in unity helped deliver a respectable demo. The scrum spreadsheet we had helped organize and keep track of our progress. Overall, I learned trigger events were a great way to move things along in this project.

# Who are we Controlling?
This demo can serve as a scene mid-way into the game should it be properly introduced to storytelling and character development. It also introduces the prospect of character complexity. I wouldn't exactly call the player a good guy, but more of an antihero as you can see the coin collecting. This is not my group's vision, but that's my headcanon if this were to be developed further. This can be seen as one of those ATARI games where the player is doing what just because.

# Anything you wish you could've done different?
A lot of things really, I wish I wasn't that preoccupied with my other classes such as web development so this game could've met a greater potential. Much like how my Virtual Reality project went, when it comes to time it's a valuable asset to have. Prior experience in that project taught me the basics which I greatly appreciate given how much options there are in Unity which can make it feel overwhelming. The C# programming language challenged me outside my usual c/c++ usage, and it caught me off guard in my previous project. The trading system would've been an excellent feature with the currency system already established, it would give the coins value.

Without further to say, here is the gameplay demo.
